Tasks Completed:
- Fixed the EOF exception error that I was facing yesterday. 
    - I had to initialize the Root block properly, even if it's empty.
- More Testing was done.

Problems Encountered:
- My extract method is not working 100%.

Next session:
- Fix extract method to make sure it can handle all scenairos thrown at it.

Thoughts:
- I am glad I am doing extensive testing to catch all the errors.
- I am getting better at debugging code by using print statments to see where the problems are occuring.
