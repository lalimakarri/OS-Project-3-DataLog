Tasks Completed:
-Added Command: extract
  -Asks the user for a file name to save the index data.
  - If the specified file already exists, the program asks for confirmation to overwrite it.
  - Once confirmed, the program saves all key-value pairs in the index to the file as comma-separated pairs.
-Error Handling:
  - If there is an issue saving the file, an error message is displayed to inform the user.
-Refined the quit:
- Exits the program when the user types "quit".

-Tested the code to make sure evything is working smoothly.

Thoughts:
- My goal today was to implement the components that were missing so that I can start translating the code I have now into B-Tree, now that I have a visual in my head on how teh code should fucntion.
- This code acts as my skeleton for when I am doing the B-tree implemetation.

Next Session:
- I will focus on enhancing error handling and ensuring a smooth user experience.
