Tasks Completed/What I wanted to accomplish: 
- Did some testing to evaluate the functionality of the current code.
- Focused on identifying areas that work as expected and areas that need further improvements.

Modifications Made:
- Changed the file mode in the `openIndexFile()` function to "rw" (read-write).
- Modified the `insertKeyValue()` function to append key-value pairs to the file.
- Fixed the data formatting issue when writing key-value pairs to a file in the `extractToFile()` function.
- Error Handling.

Thoughts so far:
- I am getting a better understanding on how I am going to do this in B-Tree format. I am able to visual what should be happening. 

Next Session:
- I plan on writing the code so that it adheres to B-tree format and it follows the requirements given by the professor.
