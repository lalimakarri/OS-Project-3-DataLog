Tasks Completed:
- Was able to debug the code and fix the extract method.
- The problem was occuring because of incorrect handling of file formatting during extraction. 
  - There were issues with how key-value pairs were being written to the file, resulting in incorrect output.

Next session:
- Test the program with all the functions available.
- Do some stress testing.
- Make sure that it works in multiple scenarios and various combinations to ensure that all fucntionlites are working.

Thoughts:
- I am very pleased with the prgress I have made thus far. 
- Debugging took longer than I have anticipated that it would, but the outcome was good, as I got the issue resolved. 
- I have had no new thoughts as I think I am nearning the end to this program. I just need to keep testing it further.
