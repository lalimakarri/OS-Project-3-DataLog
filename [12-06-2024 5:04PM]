Tasks Completed/What I wanted to accomplish:
- Changed from hashmap logic to B-tree logic.
- Currently debugging to see where the problems are arising as print and search methods are not working properly. 

Problems facing:
- The print and search methods are not working as expected.

Next session:
- Fix atleast the search method so it starts wokring again.

Thoughts:
- Little bit of a slower day as I need to debug where the problems are coming from.
- A good day, as I accomplished the most important thing, converting the code to B-Tree Logic.
