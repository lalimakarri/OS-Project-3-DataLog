Thoughts so far:
- Read through all the instructions and gained a solid understanding of what needs to be implemented to create an interactive B-tree manager.
- Started by defining data structures for the header and node.
- Using Java for the implementation.
- Decided to begin the code using a HashMap to get a better understanding of the structure and the code.

Plan for this session:
- Focus on building the basic structure of the program.
- Start implementing a menu with commands such as "create" and "open" to manage the index file.
- Begin setting up state management to track if a file is open and its name.
- Implement basic error handling for the commands that require an open file.
- Main goal is just to get a good understanding about everything.
