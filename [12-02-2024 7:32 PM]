Thoughts so far:
- Created a basic menu with commands: create, open, and quit.
- Made commands case-insensitive (e.g., "CREATE" or "create" both work).
- Added state management to track whether an index file is open and the file's name.
- Implemented the following commands:
  - create: Allows the user to create and open a new file.
  - open: Allows the user to open an existing file.
  - quit: Exits the program.
- Added error handling for commands that require an open file.

Plan for this session:
- Continue to expand on the menu system and add additional commands related to file management.
- Implement functionality for file creation and opening, ensuring state management is maintained.
- Test the implemented commands and error handling for potential bugs.

- Everything that I wanted to accomplish today was accomplished.
- Next session I am planning on implementing create, open, and insert.
