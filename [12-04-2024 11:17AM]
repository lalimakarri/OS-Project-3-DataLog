# Tasks Completed
Insert:
- Implemented functionality to insert a key-value pair into the index file.
  - The program prompts the user to input a key and value.
  - If the key already exists in the file, an error message is displayed to inform the user that the key cannot be duplicated.
  - If the key is unique, the key-value pair is successfully inserted into the file.

Code:
- After I added the Insert logic, I went back and enhanced the code to follow an Hashmap. The requirments are to follow a B-tree, but I am trying to understand how the code should fucntion and work before implementing the B-tree Logic.
  -I am doing this becuase I am able to get a better grasp on how everything should layout. 

# Thoughts So Far:
- The project is progressing well. I implemted code to insert and I polished up the code for open, quit and create.
- I encountered no major issues with the functionality for creating new files, opening existing files, or inserting key-value pairs.

# Next Session:
- I am going to implement code for search.
