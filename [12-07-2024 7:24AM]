Tasks Completed:
- Fixing Search:
  - Needed to fix the way I was implementing B-tree Traversal:
    - Worked on correctly traversing the B-tree nodes. The traversal now checks the keys within each node and follows the appropriate child pointers if necessary, making sure that the search algorithm works as expected.
  - Fix Key Storage and Retrieval:
    - Due to the B-tree implemtation having some error the way I was retriveing keys got messed up.
    - Made sure that keys and values are written and read correctly within the B-tree blocks. Verifyed that the data is stored properly and that the correct values are retrieved during the search operation.

-Encountred an EOF exception error while trying to test my code (this occured at 2:56PM)

Next Steps:
- My main next goal is now to fix the exception error in my code.
Then...
- Continue testing the `search` method after the fixes to ensure that it works correctly for various cases.
- Further improvements may be needed for optimizing the B-tree traversal or handling edge cases.

Thoughts:
-Eveything is going well so far. Encounting set back here and there, but I am able to debug and move on.
