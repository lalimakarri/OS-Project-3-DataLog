Tasks Comleted:
Search Functionality:
- Implemented functionality that prompts the user to enter a key.
- The program searches the index for the entered key.
- If the key is found, it prints the corresponding key-value pair.
- If the key is not found, an error message is displayed to inform the user.

Thoughts so far:
- The code is going well so far. I have been accomplishing all my goals as to what I want finsihed everytime I work on this.

Things I accomplished beyond:
Load Functionality:
- Implemented functionality to read a file containing comma-separated key-value pairs.
- The program inserts each key-value pair from the file into the index.
- The expected format for the load file is: `key1:value1, key2:value2, ...`

Print Functionality:
- Added functionality to print all key-value pairs stored in the index.
- This allows the user to view all the data in the index in a readable format.

Next Session:
- I plan on implemeting extract.
